ANTIPARASITIC PRODUCTS AND THE GUT MICROBIOME

By Dr. Michael W. Fox 
Addressing the widespread use of parasiticides and advocating oral or injectable rather than topical products in companion animals on a case-by-case rather than routine, blanket approach, because of concerns over environmental contamination, as reported by Loeb and Scally (1) is a positive initiative. The potential risks to the environment are considerable, however, even with the oral and injectable products. (2). 
But oral and injectable parasiticides, including some known to cause seizures and unprovoked aggression in dogs, may cause other health and behavioral issue by adversely impacting the gut microbiome. (3). Conspecific aggression has been correlated with changes in the gut microbiome in rescued dogs. (4). Some dogs are reported to have become aggressive after treatment with parasiticides which was theorized several years ago by veterinarian Dr. Margo Roman (personal communication) to have been caused by oxytocin depletion, and improved after she provided microbiome restorative therapy.

 Research has found that certain gut microbiota in the intestinal microbiome can affect the production of oxytocin in the intestinal epithelium. Oxytocin regulates social behavior and feeding, and is usually produced in the hypothalamus. However, gut bacteria can stimulate the production of oxytocin through the gut hormone secretin, which is produced in enteroendocrine cells. This process has been called "upregulation" of endogenous oxytocin.  The probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (formerly known as Lactobacillus reuteri) has been shown to not only increase circulating oxytocin levels but also oxytocin expression in the brain in rodents, effects which have been linked with metabolism, wound healing, sociability, and behavior. (5, 6, 7).
It is notable that treatment with probiotics to boost oxytocin levels helped reduce obesity, an all-too-common problem in dogs. (8).

 Prescribing probiotics, therefore, to dogs being given parasiticides on a case-by-case basis and routinely for heartworm prevention, might prove beneficial in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and gut-brain axis and in preventing aggression and other behavioural problems. The benefits including so-called postbiotics in fermented foods in the human and canine diets should also be considered. (9, 10). 

Microbiome restorative therapy for various behavioural and health issues in human and non-human patients is also being recognized more widely (11,12,13), notably the finding that overweight cats have changes in their gut microbiome similar to how diet affects the human gut, potentially helping researchers better understand how gut bacteria influence diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes. (14). Also, since glyphosate and other herbicide residues harm the gut-brain-microbiome (15) current widespread agricultural use calls for more restricted applications, and screening especially of corn and soy products.
