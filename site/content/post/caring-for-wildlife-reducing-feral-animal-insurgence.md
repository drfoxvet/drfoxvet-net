CARING FOR WILDLIFE: REDUCING FERAL ANIMAL INSURGENCE


                  By Dr. Michael W. Fox 
Caring for all creatures great and small who are still surviving in the diminishing wild by ensuring their well-being is a responsibility all communities and countries must adopt. The harmful incursions of people, free-roaming and feral cats, dogs and pigs, and unattended cattle cannot continue to be ignored.

Domestic animals that adapt to living in the wild are called feral.  Feral pigs are becoming an increasing problem in the U.S. and Canada. See Feral Pigs Roam the South. Now Even Northern States Aren’t Safe. The swine have established themselves in Canada and are encroaching on border states like Montana and North Dakota.( https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/science/feral-pigs-canada-texas.html). They are common in Florida and southern states. Pigs put domestic pigs at risk from diseases such as African swine fever.


There is also a feral dog problem. Feral dogs have been documented in all 50 states and estimates of damage in the U.S. from these animals amount to >$620 million annually. In Texas alone, it is estimated that over $5 million in damage to livestock annually can be attributed to feral dogs.(Feral Dogs - Wildlife Damage Management https://wildlife-damage-management.extension.org ›) 

Feral and owned, free-roaming dogs spread diseases such as distemper and parvovirus that put endangered and protected species like the wolf at risk.

According to a recent review, ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75828-6#Sec1 Belsare, A., Vanak, A.T. Modelling the challenges of managing free-ranging dog populations. Sci Rep 10, 18874 2020. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75828-6)   “The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is found on every continent that humans have settled1. More than 70% of the global dog population (estimated at > 700 million to ~ 1 billion) comprises of free-ranging dogs (FRD)1,2. In many developing countries, FRD are associated with the transmission of zoonotic diseases such as rabies, zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, canine echinococcosis, and soil borne helminths3,4,5,6,7. Rabies alone is responsible for an estimated 60,000 human deaths per year worldwide, with a majority of these deaths occurring in Asia and Africa8. In addition, FRD are an important and emerging threat for livestock9,10 as well as biodiversity2,11,12,13,14. Furthermore, FRD also suffer from poor health, high mortality, and abuse15.Amongst the countries with the largest FRD populations in the world, India stands out as it accounts for an estimated 20 million dog bite cases per year and around 20,000 dog-mediated human rabies deaths per annum8,16,17. Apart from being a hotspot of dog-mediated rabies deaths, dog attacks also result in direct human fatalities in India (e.g. https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/stray-dogs-terror-in-sitapur-six-children-killed-in-one-week accessed on 19/Jun/2020). There is thus a strong and urgent need to control free-roaming dog populations. In general, efforts to control dog populations in India using a variety of lethal and non-lethal methods have been unsuccessful so far, even though this has been attempted for over 200 years18.” ( Numbers refer to reference citations in this article).


Worldwide, domestic dogs have contributed to 11 vertebrate extinctions and are a known or potential threat to at least 188 threatened species worldwide. (Tim S. Doherty, et al. The global impacts of domestic dogs on threatened vertebrates, Biological Conservation, Part A, 210: 56-59, 2017 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.007.) 

 They also compete with wild predators and scavengers for food. 
Both owned and unvaccinated and feral dogs and cats pose a greater public health risk, as potential carriers of rabies, than wild carnivores such as coyotes and foxes. 

The feral cat problem is also a major factor in the loss of song birds and small mammals and spread of diseases to wild felids. According to one assessment,  “The total across all species of when reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals are included in the tally, scientists estimate that feral cats in the U.S. kill 6.9 to 20.7 billion animals annually. Outside of human-driven habitat destruction, there is arguably no greater threat to small wildlife species—especially birds—than feral cats. Exact estimates ( of this feral cat population) vary, but various sources report that there are between 50 and 70 million feral cats in the United States. Some reports point to figures above 100 million. That’s a lot of cats, considering American pet owners only registered 94.2 million pet cats in 2017". ( https://www.bard.edu/cep/blog/?p=11962). 


In the extensive review by A. Trouwborst et al, Domestic cats and their impacts on biodiversity: A blind spot in the application of nature conservation law. People Nat. 2020; 2: 235– 250. https://doi.org/10.1002/pan3.10073: the authors state “Domestic cats have also been implicated at broader scales, in the global extinction of at least 63 species—40 birds, 21 mammals, two reptiles—which is to say 26% of all known contemporary extinctions in these species groups (Doherty, Glen, Nimmo, Ritchie, & Dickman, 2016). Likewise, domestic cats currently endanger at least a further 367 species which are at risk of extinction." (Doherty et al., 2016).


The “Wild” Horse Issue


America’s wild horses or mustangs are not a native, indigenous species but an invasive, feral, formerly domesticated one. In one review on the origins of these beautiful, spirited and intelligent beings, “the disappearance of the horse in North America between 13,000–11,000 years ago” is noted. (Kirkpatrick, J.F., and P.M. Fazio. Revised January 2010. Wild Horses as Native North American Wildlife. The Science and Conservation Center, Zoo, Billings, Montana,   (https://awionline.org/content/wild-horses-native-north-american-wildlife#)


 Archaeologists have used ancient DNA samples to identify the genetic homeland of modern horses, where the animals were first domesticated around 4,200 years ago. They found that modern domestic horses probably originated on the steppes around the Volga and Don rivers, now part of Russia, before spreading across Eurasia, ultimately replacing all pre-existing horse lineages. (Librado, P., Khan, N., Fages, A. et al. The origins and spread of domestic horses from the Western Eurasian steppes. Nature 598, 634–640 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04018-9).


The estimated 86,000 wild mustangs that roam the West are at the center of raging controversy between horse-protectors and ecosystem conservationists. (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/86000-wild-mustangs-that-roam-the-west-are-at-the-center-of-raging-controversy). The Bureau of Land Management periodically accepts public comments on proposed plans to reduce herds of wild horses. For details visit https://www.blm.gov/programs/wild-horse-and-burro/herd-management. 


Widespread and overabundant feral horses and burros wreak havoc on the rangeland ecosystem by overgrazing native plants, exacerbating invasive establishment and out-competing other ungulates. As a result, water resources are impacted and important and iconic wildlife species are threatened. One evaluation found strong support for the interactive negative effect of elevated temperature and subsequent increased activity of horses at water sources on drinking patterns of pronghorn antelope and mule deer. These findings indicate that feral horses further constrain access to an already limited resource for native species in a semi-arid environment.  (https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2096).


Predation is one natural population control and cattle ranchers have virtually exterminated the main predator of equines, the cougar or mountain lion.


This entire feral horse issue is a mess and has been mishandled by state and federal agencies for decades who put the interests of cattle ranchers before those of humane treatment of these equines and sound range management with provision of feed and water especially during periods of extended drought.


Roundups and horse auctions have resulted in thousands of these beautiful animals being transported to Mexico for slaughter after slaughtering in the U.S. was prohibited following petitions by horse-protection associations. This is an instance of good intentions having unforeseen harmful consequences.


Horses, sheep and cattle all graze differently and with good rangeland management over-grazing and habitat degradation can be prevented and all three species, at low densities, could sustainably co-habit. But most cattle ranchers see sheep, traditionally, and now the mustangs, as competitors to be exterminated, especially with the high demand for water and feed for their livestock with Climate Change extended droughts and extreme weather events. 


 It is the cattle industry and associated predator-extermination and not the wild horses that are a blight on public and most private rangelands. Humans have taken over the role of predators and, therefore, some reduction of horse numbers may be indicated along with cattle roundups and finishing for slaughter. Many captured horses can be adopted out to responsible horse and land owners and stallions vasectomized and released  back into the wild to help with population control.



Veterinarian Wayne Dollarhide sent me this communication in 2021: 
“A little history of the area where most of the "wild" horse problems are. There were historically no large grazing animals year- round in this area. Herds of deer, antelope, and elk migrated through the area spending only a couple months twice yearly in the area. There were no horses in the area in the mid- 1800s, reference the book on the travels of John Freemont and personal family history.  My family came through the area on a wagon train in 1857 and after a few years in north central California returned to the area and homesteaded in the 1860s. I grew up on the homestead ranch and was involved with it and other holdings until we sold in 1999.

As was my family, most of the settlers were from the southern mid-west where while there can be times that it is cold, livestock can usually survive without supplementing their pastures. Things were working relatively well for the settlers as they developed herds of cattle and flocks of sheep which they grazed on the high desert during the summer months and brought in to the lower elevation home ranches during the winter. Winter of 1886 was particularly severe and resulted in somewhere in the area of 85% of the livestock starving to death. 

The ranchers now realized that it would be necessary to store food (hay) for the livestock during the winter months. While many of the settlers came west using oxen for draft animals, they were too slow compared to horses for larger acreage. This created a need for large numbers of draft horses. Ranchers imported some draft horses and began breeding and raising them to meet their needs. These horses were ranged on the high desert and gathered twice yearly and at these times the young males were castrated and the three -year- old geldings kept on the ranch to either be trained for draft work or sold to other ranches for draft.

 Secondly there developed a huge need for lighter horses for the army to use as remounts so a second group of horses were also being raised and ranged in separate areas of the high desert. These were also gathered twice yearly to castrate the young males and bring in the castrated three -and four -year olds to be trained for riding. This part of the raising horses continued through WW l then went away with the military using internal combustion engine power. The need for draft horses continued until the end of WW ll. 


After the end of WW ll and the end of gas rationing, ranchers began acquiring tractors to replace horses and by the late 1950s seeing draft horses working became a curiosity. The decline of the use of draft horses accelerated during the Korean war, the combination of WW ll and the Korean war left the area without enough men to accomplish the work needed on ranches. A ten- year old boy with a tractor could do as much as two men with horses, a thirteen year old boy with a tractor could do as much as four men with horses. (That was me). 


Due to decreased need for horses and lack of men able to gather those on the range, some started to interbreed and become feral. In 1953 the BLM gathered these horses and cleaned up the range. A few escaped but were kept under control by ranchers until the 1970s.

I will not pretend that ranchers did not, especially before the Taylor Grazing Act of 1936, abuse the range. Ranchers now are mostly well educated and work very hard to be good stewards of the land. Cattle are only allowed on the range from May to October and must be rotated twice yearly to give one third of their range a year rest. There are so few sheep left in the area that they are no longer a real factor. 

 Since 1970s, when gathering the horses was outlawed, the horse population has exploded and since they are there year- round they are literally destroying the area and have done so to the extent that they are starving to death in winter. Starvation has become the limiting factor on their population. 
I wish that I could take you out horseback and show you what these "wild" horses do to the environment.  Unfortunately, I am to the age I no longer able to ride and no longer have horses. If you are truly interested in seeing this, we can probably arrange to take a UTV and see some of the damage.” 


I would welcome such an in-field experience with this caring and informed veterinarian but my age and other priorities prohibit beyond my research and writing for the animals and the environment and advocating the principle and praxis of One Health. 
I support the humane population control of horses, including the protection of cougars (https://americanwildhorsecampaign.org/natural-predators)  in the ecosystems they share with antelope and mule deer-along with reduction in cattle and sheep. Throughout much of human history horses have served us and suffered. It should be a matter of national honor and public pride to protect wild horses by reducing their numbers to help restore natural biodiversity in their managed preserves-our “public lands”.


These feral animal issues are world-wide and include cattle and camels in Australia as well as rabbits and cats, where it is estimated that invasive species are beginning to outnumber indigenous ones, many of which they kill or out-compete. 

Collectively the negative impact of feral animals on biodiversity must be addressed.
 
The 2022 World Economic Forum lists biodiversity loss as one of the top three global risks, because the loss of Nature doesn't just impact plants and animals. Destruction of forests, wetlands and other natural ecosystems deprives us increasingly of clean air and water, and results in the release of “emergent” diseases, pestilence and pests, which natural biodiversity helps contain. The Biden administration has yet to sign on to support the UN Convention on Biological Diversity 2022 resolution, agreed to by most other countries, to take concerted action to protect at least one third of the world’s natural ecosystems, aquatic and terrestrial.
 
The issue of invasive species, plant and animals wild and feral, and free-roaming livestock cannot be ignored: nor can the land and natural resource use, along with pesticides and various pharmaceuticals in the intensive production of animal-derived foods (eggs, poultry, meat, fish and dairy) from inhumane and polluting factory farms and feedlots. We must make fundamental changes in how we treat domesticated animals for food, as pets and for other purposes, and those who become feral at home and abroad.
