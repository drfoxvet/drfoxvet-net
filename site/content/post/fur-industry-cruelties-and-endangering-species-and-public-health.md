FUR INDUSTRY CRUELITES AND  ENDANGERING SPECIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH: TIME TO END
                                                   By Dr. Michael W. Fox

“Shame of Fur” demonstrations across the U.S. a few decades ago against the wearing of animals’ pelts as fashion and status statements needs re-activation considering the rising demand for such animal parts especially in Asian countries now receiving much of what is “harvested” in North America and Europe and enjoying more “disposable” income.

Hundreds of thousands of caged Minks have been destroyed in several countries because they contracted the COVID-19 infection from infected workers. Then these Minks infected other workers, cats around some of the fur farms, even spreading this viral disease to wildlife nearby. Minks are either being quarantined or “depopulated” in Utah, Wisconsin, Oregon, British Columbia, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Poland, France, Switzerland, Faroe Islands, Russia and S. Africa, to date ( for documentation see  https://drfoxonehealth.com/post/preventing-pandemics-like-covid-19-and-other-animal-to-human-diseases),

The crowded conditions on these and other fur farms, especially for foxes who are susceptible to this virus, but less so than Minks, and the stress of such active animals being confined in small cages their entire lives until they mature and have full coats, are grossly inhumane and create ideal conditions for such zoonotic disease to become established. For these reasons the captive propagation of wildlife species, even Wolves, for their fur should be illegal. But it is profit-driven and prohibition is politically a hot potato so consumers should step in and say “No”.

They should also say “No” to any furs and skins from wild animals like baby seals who are clubbed to death and the millions of others who are trapped and snared, such as Beaver, Coyote, Fox, (Red, Grey and Arctic), Bobcat and Pine Marten. Trapping and snaring (which is death by strangulation) is not only extremely cruel it is also indiscriminate, non-target species being caught.

 Non-target species can include people’s cats and especially dogs out in the woods and even endangered species such as the Canada Lynx of whom there are 50-200 left in northern Minnesota. The Center for Biological Biodiversity filed a law suit in December 2020 against the Minnesota Dept. of Natural resources for allowing trapping and snaring methods that do not include “lynx exclusion devices” in the northern part of the state which is the last stronghold for the federally protected Lynx.

Globally, wild animals now represent about 15-20% of all furs used in the trade. In North America, the largest producer of high -quality wild furs, the proportion is closer to 50%. Species include muskrat, beaver, raccoon, marten, fox, coyote, bobcat and lynx. Smaller quantities of wild furs also come from Russia (sable), Europe (fox), South America (fox, nutria), and other regions.
It is unlikely that the U.S. or any other government will ever move to prohibit legal and illegal exports of wild furs and other wild animal products and parts (including bear paws and bile) until a new paradigm of Global Trade is established based on international agreements over animal and environmental protection. Yet this is ultimately in the best interests of public health and a sustainable economy which depend upon ecosystem health and optimal natural biodiversity

Consumers can facilitate such initiative by voting with their money and not purchase any fur garments, accessories or products. I recall being on Johnny Carson’s Tonight show several years ago with fellow guest actress Shelley Winters who was wearing a full-length Lynx coat. During a commercial break I asked her if she knew that the Lynx had been all trapped and her response was she thought they had been ranch raised and that anyway, Marlon Brando had given it to her so she thought it would be OK.. “Ranch raised” sounds more humane, but fur ranches are indeed cruel confinement operations that have no place in a humane and informed society.

Over 95% of fur sold globally, comes from farmed animals, such as mink, foxes, raccoon dogs, rabbits and chinchillas. To preserve the pelts, animals on fur farms are killed by inhumane methods, such as gassing and head-to-tail electrocution. Fox and raccoon dogs are generally electrocuted through the mouth and anus; a method with potential to inflict severe pain and distress on the animal.

Raccoon dogs, originally from Asia, have escaped from fur farms in Finland and are now living in the wild, expanding into Sweden and governments are attempting to control by extermination.

An additional source of fur for the apparel industry comes from street-harvested cats and dogs in China and other countries (where their meat is also consumed), their fur being dyed and even patterned to look like it came from a wild animal. It may be sold as faux or synthetic fur. ( See Flawed Laws Mean Your Faux Fur Could Come From Dogs And Cats, www.huffingtonpost.ca › faux-fur_b_12121648)
