                  AN EYE FOR AN EYE


                By Dr. Michael W. Fox 


“An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,” is the famous and timely statement of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, India (1869- 1948). The human death and injury toll we are witnessing in Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Sudan, and Yemen is the spreading of this blindness and its tragic consequences to all sides, including all the millions of animals in their communities. 

While reflecting on Gandhi’s words, I came across a relevant article by Indian physicians Dr. Harish Gupta and Dr. Satish Kumar, in their article in the British Medical Journal on the ethics of gaining medical information from Nazi atrocities entitled “Acknowledge, in the curriculum, those who suffered for the advancement of medical science.” ( BMJ 2020;368:m714). They conclude that: “To aspire for an everlasting peace in our world, we need to realise that the human race is one and all the perpetrators of violence need to be equated - regardless of their religion, nationality, allegiance or ideology. On the other side, we believe that all the sufferers deserve our equal sympathy, care, moral support, and a feeling of belonging; regardless of their demographic characteristics.”


With both eyes open we can surely, make peace with each other, evolve, even see the future, and make it better. We and other social animals have mirror neurons in our brains that enable feeling for others and interpretation of their behavior in self-referential terms. (Acharya S, Shukla S. Mirror neurons: Enigma of the metaphysical modular brain. J Nat Sci Biol Med. 2012 Jul;3(2):118-24. doi: 10.4103/0976-9668.101878.). Philosopher Martin Buber called this the “I-Thou” experience and state. 

Some emotions in social animals are highly contagious and generally have survival value except in humans when manipulated and ignited for harmful ideological and political ends.


If we do not control our emotional reactions and utilize our mirror neurons and let wars continue instead of collectively addressing the rapidly deteriorating condition of the environment-Nature- this Anthropocene era will become a global dystopia.  More frequent and extensive forest fires have brought on what some scientists call the Pyrocene age. Earth could see the breaching of the 1.5 degree Celsius of the Paris Climate Agreement’s aspirational limit by 2029 rather than the mid-2030s. (Lamboll, R.D., and associates, Assessing the size and uncertainty of remaining carbon budgets. Nat. Clim. Chang. (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-023-01848-5).


We are already witnessing more extreme climatic events, pandemic diseases also decimating wildlife populations as with H5N1 avian influenza virus; internecine strife over dwindling natural resources, community violence, child and animal abuse, deaths from drug-overdose; and suicides now increasing in younger age groups along with cancer. Most cancers have an “environmental” origin, meaning, caused by us.
 It is self-evident from a One Health perspective that harming the environment, Nature/biodiversity, is a crime against humanity and should be prosecuted since we and all life are connected. Opponents of the Extinction Rebellion need to be brought to trial.


All nations must now make peace and cooperate in restoring the environment, natural biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and agricultural sustainability for the health and security of generations to come. And all of us need to see each other with eyes wide open and put an end to sexism, racism, and speciesism.
