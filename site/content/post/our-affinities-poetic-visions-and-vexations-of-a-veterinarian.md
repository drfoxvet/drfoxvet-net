If Fish Could Scream


I had a dream

That fish could scream.
So there were no fishermen
For none could bear to hear
The screams of netted fish
Or tolerate the painful cries
Of those impaled on spear and hook.
Did God give silence to the fish
That we might never hear nor feel
Their fear and pain,
Just so we can eat them
With no twinge of shame
Or fellow-feeling?
We might ask what kind 
Of God makes all fish mute
Who in their silence,
Suffer suffocation in our trawler nets,
Pain and terror on our hooks?
Perhaps that we might learn
To feel through silence
For the mute, the weak, the dumb,
Of our kind and fish kind
And all kind great and small.

               The Panther
Just before my thirteenth birthday
I joined the spirit of a captive panther
As she paced and rubbed herself red raw
Against a polished tree stump with every turn
Making tracks and patinas of blood
Around her iron and concrete universe.
As I stood beside a potted palm
In the glass domed conservatory
At the Paris zoo--Le Jardin des Plantes,
I saw the bars through her eyes
Spinning to the cadence of her measured minuet
As she slowly ground herself into the final freedom
Of death and liberation with graceful deliberation.
Perhaps the spinning took away her pain. 
Through her mesmerized, hypnotic gaze
I saw through the haze of my tears
Grey shadow people passing oblivious,
While she writhed like a black serpent
 In the slow suicide of her repetitive motion
Under the compulsion of wildness for freedom
To end all of her spirit's longing and soul's desire.
Then I saw the bars were also around the people
Who never stopped to look and see and care.
I felt closer to my panther and her pain and fate
Than to my own kind so blind to her tragic plight.

When I left the panther to her chosen end,
In broken French I asked a keeper to take me 
To the director of the zoo menagerie
In the urban heart of gay Paris in 1950.
The keeper led me to the official’s office
Through a maze of glass cases
Filled with stuffed and pickled creatures
From every continent and sea.
Up several flights of marble stairs
I met the man in charge
Who waved his hands and said,
“What can we do? That is how she is.”

Half a century later I read Rilke’s poem
About a panther in the same plight and place.
I wonder how many lived and died that way
In the century between our visits
And for why. Was it ten, twenty or more
Who were tortured in that corner cage?
Suffering the severance of living souls
From all wildness, being, purpose,
I find such zoos, like the animal circus
Make me alien to my species, and ashamed.

Bovine Ruminations

I remember that sweet vision
Of cows quietly grazing
When I was deep thinking
In the time of my youth
Of what I should do with my life.
When the cows began glowing
In my searching mind’s eye
As the bus sped me by,
I knew what to do; what I’m doing 
Right now to recall
The cows in the meadow and the god in all.

Sad the trusting cow
Torn of her calf
And calling all the night.
Let us pray.

Lost the innocent calf
In his narrow crate
And fattening for the plate.
Let us pray.

Goaded the weary ox
Bearing our loads
And ploughing all the day.
Let us pray.

Bloody the noble bull
Dying in the ring
And bellowing heaven’s rage.
Let us pray.

THEY CAME DOWN FROM THE TREES


Complete in themselves,
Safe and secure, the monkeys
Kept to the trees, wanting no more.

Their needy cousins came down
Learned to make fire,
Turned stones into iron
For ploughs and for war.

So different they were
From those in the trees,
Calling themselves human
 
So clever indeed,
Playing god with atoms and genes
Laying waste to the old world
To make way for the new.

 I KNEW A CHILD

 I knew a child who looked
 Into the eyes of animals,
 And saw the self in others:

 A child who learned the language
 Of the trees and spoke to rocks;
 Could fly on clouds and dream.

 Born to know through feeling,
Children flourish or perish:
So too the animals.

 What world we make for ours
  And theirs, can blind in pain
  Or bind in light to love.

 I knew a child who saw the light
   And felt all pain but shone
   With joy in love for all.

  Uncorrupted like eternal spring
   The child within moves on,
    Secure in a universe embraced.

    In grace and wonder,
   Innocent and selflessness,
   This child is parent to us all.

 GOD RIGHT, GOD WRONG

Have you found the God of little things?
Felt divinity around, within
The awe inspiring miracle of life
In the Dream that is dreaming us?

Have you the right God, and I the wrong?
Better, then, for all to have none.
In what God’s name have many killed,
Been killed, tortured and oppressed;
Converted and perverted?
In what God’s name have many loved,
Been healed, made whole;
Redeemed and reconciled?

Some say the way to God
Is the way of peace and renunciation.
Renounce all gods of our own making,
Created in our own vain image,
Along with hatred, greed and fear---
But not the God of little things.

Separated from belief and disbelief
We discover divinity within each other. 
The truth that sets us free to serve.
To heal and to make whole
Through our sense of the sacred, 
In the sacraments of silent oaks
And standing stones.

   NEW-YEAR RE-FLECTIONS

When love, suffering, service
Are one, there is grace within;
Arrogance and fear are gone.

When fear and hatred are one
With arrogance and power,
There is peace and joy for none.

Human spirit, Earth are one.
The worlds we make
Reflect and shape the soul.

Unspoken dread, living
With the dead forgotten,
Blinds us to the sacred deep

 Where soul-mates meet
 In sanctuary to sanctify
 Life and death in trust and love.

Compassionate service is all
Amidst inhuman-kind’s demise
And the great awakening to Care.

In a world of suffering
What pleasure can there be
Except to serve, help heal?

No time to wonder if you are loved
 Or are unlovable, or if your wants
Are childhood longings unfulfilled.

A broken heart, a broken world,
Call for every able soul
To see and feel and know

The end of suffering from ignorance,
Arrogance, hatred, fear,
Is in simple acts of loving kindness

To all beings great and small
Whom we embrace in reverence
And suffer all to come to us.

COMING TO SOIUX FALLS, S. DAKOTA
 Prairie, plains, all torn;
The blight of cattle, corn.
 Poisoned streams.
 Suicidal dreams.
 Dead bitch in ditch,
Car-flat ‘possums, ‘coons
Cardboard cat cut-outs
Pave my highway.
Soft feet of Sioux,
Buffalo echo silence.
All the taker’s money gained
Will never be sustained.
Not worth a tinker’s cuss.
Renunciation a distant call
To hallow all,
So glad coyotes sing.

                AUGUST EVENING
Reaching out now, this soft summer eve,
as tree frogs and crickets symphonize
to call up storms, or peace, in the voice
of many in the heart of One,
I find the root connections of my being.
 I become their tree; their song and night,
 and they, my doorway, senses,
guides to show us all the way:
The way of seers and prophets,
Shamans’ journeys into ancestral realms
 primordial, protean thoughts,
as well the boundless source of all wisdom
that inspires our art, informs our science:
And illumes all life. 
  Aug. 2006
 

  FLYING NOT AWAY
Oozing out into unintelligible realms
where the mind is jangled into mush,
the wandering soul is set adrift,
severed from all broken hearts. 
The endless journey starts
when there is no home, no returning.
Only the outward flow, an expanding universe,
gathering its past, all riches,
cherished memories and pain.
All remorse and regret remain
forever buried under glaciers of time.
With no hope there is no future:
Only an eternity of heaven in hell.
 
Flying not away, but towards
the destination of an open heart,
following the song lines
of air churned wings
and more ancient souls
into tomorrow, another season,
to find the place of all abiding
grace and peace: A consummation
devoutly wished, ordained 
by wild spirits, Earth bound, yet free.
Free to serve without servitude,
the Snow geese sing antiphonal anthems
as they pass above me in this vibrant night
into some new day where I am waiting
beyond the curve of light
to welcome them in silent gratitude.

 HEALING THE RAIN
Everywhere the rain burns into soft skins of self and soil
and tender leaves and wings, poisoning all 
once nurtured and sustained. Nothing is immune, 
or can be cleansed and healed by waters once so pure,
without the tears of angels and wisdom’s loving care.
 
Who in human or other mortal form suffers for the rain, 
must bear the pain of all. All suffering is one.
All beings strive and rise toward the Light 
they cherish, nurture and sustain. 
Each becomes, as grass or elephant, tree or man, 
the mother, midwife, giver to a living Earth.
 
Through them the All is manifest: 
Immanent and omnipresent,
until blind hearts evolve to poison the rain,
not feeling the good in all and all in good;
not treating water as their mother, sister
lover, brother---the Sacred Other in the rain.
Only what they see is real; feelings are unreal.
 
The rains will continue to anoint us with our sins 
until we wash away the veil of separation. 
For are we not all water beings?
When we harm the skies we harm ourselves.
Our finer feelings, like the wind, we must trust
to inform and guide our own emergence
into the Light of wisdom, beauty and gratitude.

THE BEAST WITHIN
Thinly veiled as civilized
The beast within remains contained.
Outsiders think it tame.
 
Well trained, the child becomes the man,
Respected citizen, father of two:
Two more beasts to be contained.
 
Well trained for circus life,
They act upon command
Or crack their whips and smiles.
 
Knowing not what freedom is,
The beast is tamed, and life goes on.
Some break out; such calamity.
 
From one insanity into another
More primal, urgent, cruel,
For the beast within was never held
 
Nor loved. So it grew, deformed,
Contained within, beneath the carapace
Of saving face and civic pride.
 
No place to hide from naked truth
The beast within consumes itself
And men are broken, empty shells.

                             IN WILDNESS
 In wildness we find the sum of all our fears and longing
Where feral hearts beat Earth drums into ecstatic revelation
Through dance and song, and trance of Light
On shimmering leaves, rippling streams, eyes of wolves
And our shadow-souls, vibrant, trembling at the openings
Of cave and consciousness. Some scream, rant and rave,
So intense the Light of truth, dismembering lies;
 Then retreat into the security of the known.
 
In wildness is the Light we fear, revere and sanctify.
Dream-makers and earth-shakers make war
Because they share no feeling ,vision, understanding. 
One destroys while the other nurtures and sustains. 
One species of two minds cuts a whole world into two.
 
 Now wildness is defiled, domesticated, civilized, commercialized
By mammonists deluded by self- righteousness and entitlement.
But with the authority of empathic wisdom we could make
A world where beauty and justice are incorruptible twins,
For the plight and suffering of one is felt and shared by all.

                      BECOMING
An eagle’s first flight is into freedom from fear 
Where resistance and supplication resonate
Like lovers elemental, ancient and wise
In the sacred union of wings and air.
As her feathers sing she soars and cries,
Circling the mountain’s echoes of affirmation
Of the miracle and ecstasy of being.

Who would tear the eagle from the sky
With gun and arrow or poisoned bait?
No one can possess such beauty
Or annihilate such power 
To rob the Earth
Of yet another child
And impoverish our souls and world. 

The eagles of the skies teach us
How to take the leap and fly
Empowered by our love of life
Beyond blind trust, hope and faith, 
Not pinioned by fear and self-doubt,
To become the wind, the rain, a tree, a wolf.
In the sanctity all these beings of our becoming
We rediscover our humanity and sanity.

                                                 AN ODE TO CHRISTMAS TREES

                                             Who mourns with me the little Evergreens
                                             By the millions severed
                                             From their roots, so soon to die?

                                             This sacrificial tree mass
                                             Of mindless Christmas commerce
                                             Dispirited, dismembering:
                                             Few remembering pagan times
                                             Of solstice celebration, ritual hallowing
                                             The Tree of Life left whole,
                                             Holy and enduring age to age.

                                            “When the trees are gone the sky will fall”
                                              The Hopi Indians prophesy.
                                              Make Christmas X-mass for these trees
                                              With rituals to restore an ever greener world.

                                             To save or plant one little tree
                                             Is a better ritual for an enlightened age
                                             Revering all that lives on Earth.

  GOING FISHING
Before you go fishing or eat a fish
Take a swim in their schools and shoals.
As their shimmering sides and colors
Suffuse your being you may find
The one mind in many and in the many
Become one. Then go deeper
To join the more solitary ones
Where the pressing silence
Births past and future, ancient forms
You recognize in dreams and in your bones.
If you retain these memories
Returning to your terrestrial domain
You may refrain from eating your relations
From the deep and weep for them
Then celebrate your contribution
To securing their abiding presence.
Beneath the surfaces of water, earth,
Skin, scale, shell, feather and fur
The Power of the World dwells and spells
The words and beauty of Earth’s creation.
In the beginning was The Word.
Only we can mute the world
Or let every glimmering being sing.

THE GREEN PEOPLE

Our blood is red from the air we share

Thanks to all things green---

The grasses, trees and those unseen,

In a world where stones become our bones

And the rains all life sustains

And courses through our veins.

But blood we spill and few dare care.

Green people and their wolves may soon be gone

So who then to remember all were one?
Sept 2013


FOR THE LOVE OF WOLVES
For some the wolf is brother,
Sacred other, she-wolf dear,
Perfect mother, wolf song
Kindling the wild in human hearts.
Teacher, totem, kindred spirit
To the First People, a mirror clear
Reflecting self-in-other
From another nation
In life’s circle shared by all. 

For others more removed,
Word and song of wolf bring fear.
The big bad wolf is near!
Childhood’s innocence, empathy,
Openness of heart and mind
To wildness, mystery,
Are disturbed, confused
By nursery rhymes, folklore, fable---
The big bad wolf is here!

Child souls severed from the whole 
Where all held sacred is secure,
Grow willing to conform,
To not believe the heart,
Trust the wisdom of the wild,
Respect and honor the sanctity
Of wolves and other nations.
Manhood comes into the broken circle
With no rites of passage, initiation, 
Except to dominate, persecute and kill.

Wolves mourn when pack mates die,
Sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers,
In the pleasure-quest of trophy hunters,
Trappers seeking the perfect pelt to sell
Imbued with suffering no wearer felt. 
In such wanton slaughter of the wolf
We sacrifice compassion, dignity, humility,
In ignorance of how the love
Of wolves once made us human. 

Language is perception, revealing
Whatever truths we live by.
Seeing the wolf in splintered ways
The Second people with no unified sensibility
Call the wolf a savage beast, livestock killer,
Carnivorous predator, biological specimen,
Renewable resource, harvested furbearer,
Hunter’s trophy, trapper’s challenge,
Icon of wilderness, endangered species.
But for the First people, the Anishiaabe,
Ma’iingan, the wolf is of the heart
And spirit shared before all words, 
One Soul, one Earth, one Truth revered.
 Oct 2012


Advice to Brother Wolf
In fear and frenzy
You try to bite the stars;
My brother, bite away
Your toes instead,
And leave no more than claws
For trapper’s jaws.
You hunger, brother
And the bait seems sweet.
Look close and see coyote
Bloated in the bushes,
And smell the fear
That dying bobcat left.
It was for you my brother---
Go away from here
And in your dreams eat out
The sadness in my heart.
March 1974

The Kill
Soft grey wolf dawn
Glides over the hill,
In silence spills
Into the glade
And tenses;
A warm, dappled shadow
Never senses
The stalking form
Quiet as morning coming
That hides and shifts
From bush to bush:
The sudden rush
Like daybreak is not felt
As the fawn falls softly
 Into sunlight
Where wolf eats and rests.
April 1975

Hunters of the North
We are always on the move
Loping easily
From space to space
Across a timeless snowfield.
We are the shadow hunters
Of the Arctic night
Who sleep in drifting snow
And dance upon the ice.
We are the voice of summer
That lasts no longer
Than the melting of our echoes
In the soft green flush of tundra life.
This is the time when hunters rest,
When cubs are born and fawns
Of deer, and moose and caribou
Thrive on sun-spawned greenery.
Soon they will be digging in the snow
And ranging out for miles
For what now lies
Rich and lush around them.
They eat for us.
If only all of us could rest together
Feast on sunlight,
There would be no need to kill,
To always be moving into winter.
March 1975


LAMENTATION OF THE LARKS
Where have all the meadow larks gone?
They filled my childhood’s soul
When they spiraled and trilled above me
In the rapture of a living world
As I lay concealed in dancing grass.

Gone too the swifts, swallows, moonbeam bats
Some insects flourish, immune to pesticides, spread disease
While cancer stalks the land, spread by human hand
Invading every home and womb.

Now silent fields in all their greenness
Belie the treason of my kind against creation
Without reason, mere expedience and greed.
Now genetically engineered seed
For livestock feed and virtual foods
Blight once hallowed land
Under corporate banners of progress, need
For which there is no redress.
Bodies, minds and spirits harmed
Spawn profitable drugs and services
As the Earth dissolves and humanity devolves.

                                                      MAN EATING DOG

                                                   One must be very hungry,
                                                    Or really like the taste
                                                    To kill and eat a dog.
                                                    It might be out of dire necessity,
                                                    Cultural norm or sacred ritual.
                                                    But any way it brutalizes
                                                    Both the killer and the killed.
                                                                      Feb. 2006

                                                 
                                                            DOGS TO ME

                                          As an infant, I found every dog
                                          A source of wonder and delight;
                                          Responsive presence, a joy
                                          To touch and eye to eye engage.

                                          As a boy they were my best of friends,
                                          More trustworthy than my peers,
                                          Incapable of betrayal:
                                          More caring, playful and aware.

                                          To this dog-grown man, every dog
                                          Is an open book to an open mind;
                                          An open mind to an open heart;
                                          A kindred spirit in canine form.

MY DOG BATMAN
You were my clock and pacemaker
Giving canine cadence to my every day. 
For fifteen years you got me up and out.
You knew the times to eat and sleep.
You were my compass needling me
Away from introspection to receive
Your unwavering affection so I in turn
Might give you undivided attention.
You shared my den and solitude,
My dreams and meditations.

I remember your wild cries of greeting,
Yowling yapping anguish and relief
From separation even brief:
The nuzzle of your cold nose against my palm
And pushes with your muzzle
To deftly place my hand upon your head
For me to touch and bless:
The earthy musk of your oval paws,
Flowery aromas in your perfumed cheeks,
And sweet hay scent where you had sat:
Your fastidious morning ritual
Of licking flanks, legs and paws
Then after face-washing like a cat,
Luxurious stretching on soft clean sheets:
Your trembling drooling jaws
Accepting treats so delicately
But anything new you always spat
To first inspect; instinctual wisdom
Of your scavenger lineage from poisoned streets.

Vivid still in memory your clear displays
To other dogs, of dominance, acceptance,
Playful intent. Shelties you adored,
Strange persons you would never trust.
You were never cowed or incautious, 
Stepping everywhere with care,
Hidden springs in stocky limbs, 
Your back-bouncing tail a gallant curl.
You always made me laugh
With your wiggle- dance and big grin
You flashed my way
Just after you had pooped!

With age came the gray on muzzle and chin,
Your shiny lithe form more swayed, toes splayed,
Eyes grown clouded, hearing impaired.
Then more and more throughout the day
You slept; walks were shorter with no play,
Proud tail drooping with uncertainty,
Pointed ears flattening with pain and fear.
Slowly disengaging, fewer tail wags
And pushes with your nose as you strove
To close the distance for a moment
Until the gaze in your sad eyes returned.
It went through me and beyond
To tell me your time to leave was close.
When your appetite for food and life
Began to fail, and veterinary care
Was no avail, the time was right
For euthanasia’s liberation because
You would rather stay and suffer
Than leave the ones you loved. 

Now that you are here no more
Perhaps on some new, unfolding path
In different form, dimension,
The unbearable emptiness that you leave
Makes life around seem so unreal;
All feeling numbed by grief. 
You will return in memory and dream
To kindle and affirm what we had shared----
Love so strong I could let you go.

Little black dog Batman,
Rescued pariah from an indifferent India,
With the advent of your death I feel
The mystery and wonder of your caste.
You were the enlightened one
For you have left your light
In my grieving soul to heal and hallow,
Illuming my way without you
Once always in my shadow,
Now one breath away until I take my last.

In memory of Batman who left this life on July 19th, 2011.

   MY RE-TIREMENT
Time to disengage
To let go of all 
That the heart cannot
Sustain, contain.
Word-weary, no repose
Time to close out this world
Having seen and loved and tried
To kindle and save the light.
 May it burn forever bright
 For all creation and inspiration
 While I decompose
 Singing the sweet refrain
 Of gratitude beyond all rage,
 Sadness in wisdom’s pain
 And silent celebration 
 Without regret but shame
  For most of human kind
  Whose limitations are also mine.

           SACRED ELEPHANTS
In the racial memory of elephants
Long before the dawn of human consciousness,
Perhaps they, like us much later,
Recognized and revered a Buddha
Or a Krishna in their midst:

 Appearing in their own image
 Once in every millennium
 To guide, inform, inspire,
Awakening them to the nature of divinity, 
The divinity in their nature,
And the power of loving kindness.

If this is true for us,
Then their truth we share 
To celebrate the sacred presence
That illumes our mortal lives.

Perhaps elephants are more enlightened,
Buddha-natured, Krishna conscious
Than we, a younger species
Beginning to evolve, recognize and revere
To save them from extinction
And all that makes us human,
Giving loving kindness to them all
And every creature great and small.
July, 2011
(Poem published in the book Giant Hearts: Travels in the World of Elephants, J.-P. Puryavaud & P. Davidar, 2015.) Inspired by Heathcote William’s book, Sacred Elephant.


CONSUMING INNOCENSE & ANIMALS
Our collective taste for animals,
For their flesh and roasted fat,
Decorative skins and furs,
Prized hunting trophies,
Even potions medical and libidinal,
Casts a long shadow
Beyond their suffering and waste
Around the world, illuming
The hypocrisy of any claim
To love and care for fellow creatures:
Of being humane, even human,
Treating fellow beings as kindred spirits,
Not commodities and consumables.
Those who take the radical leap of empathy
Growing ever alien to their own kind,
The taste of flesh and roasted fat
Becoming the tang of pain and shame,
A revulsion that is not a sacrifice
But a renunciation before communion
And the healing of all our relations.
July 2013

WHAT WE CARE TO EAT
Where are the meadow larks,
The dancing hares?
Gone the way of wolves and bears, 
And wild lands and wilderness
To grow the crops to fatten
Pigs and chickens in factory sheds,
And feedlot-cattle, sheep, horses:
Country sides industrialized
By appetites of indifferent greed,
By ignorance, not economy
And ecology defined.

Our appetite and our health
Are one, not gold and wealth.
Our appetites can change:
Restore the range, coyote sings.
Renew the countryside, larks wing
Above a recovering humanity
No longer squandering, consuming
Dreams of bears and children wild.

The call of wolf, hawk, whale
Is part of our communion,
Our spirits’ food.
No more ‘the cattle of the rich
Steal the bread of the poor.’
Our sustenance is a gentler fare.

Eating is a sacrament
Of  Thanksgiving, gratitude. 
The taste for goodness, wholeness,
Is a sense too few possess.
To adulterate or denature food
Is no less a sacrilege, a profanity, 
Than to waste, allow to spoil,
Or horde for later profit.

We are what we care to eat.
Our forks are our fates.
Kitchen anarchists, caring farmers unite!
Our plates reflect the power of place,
With local foods, organic, whole
To mirror, nurture our humanity.
 Oct. 2009 Quotation from the Mahatma, Gandhi.


  FOR DEANNA---AN ODE TO STONES
I had forgotten the songs of stones
Until you stilled my mind 
And opened my heart’s ear
To rock music in the rain
And their softer echoes under snow.

 How different are their tones
In summer sun  and winter ice.
How clear their choruses
In rolling river beds,
In mountain streams,
And their soft melodies
To mosses, flowers, trees,
Rooting in their essence. 

What symphonies they sound
With different winds
That sculpt them smooth
With licking snails
Making perfect shells
And wind bells for gales.
Their crystal presence in my bones
Give me the power
Of an ancestry profound.
Thank you Deanna, for connecting me,
And with Thou in all.

   THE WAY OF REVERENCE
There are many ways of looking.
Those who look in reverence
See in a sacred way.
To see in a sacred way
Is love’s gift to a world made profane.

There are many ways of feeling.
Those who feel reverence for all life
Know in a sacred way.
To know in a sacred way
Is love’s gift to a world of pain.

There are many ways of living.
Those who live in reverence
Live in a sacred way.
To live in a sacred way
Is love’s gift to a world made sane.

      NATURE’S HIDDEN TRUTHS
Victim, victor, opposing wills,
Predator, prey, survival of the fittest,
Nature raw, ‘red in tooth and claw’,
Men at war, compete, defeat.
Torn ‘twixt discord, concord,
Might makes right for
Disconnected discontents
While lovers take the leap
Into unfathomed depths of otherness.

In every living presence,
We find a part of us abides-
The Inua of the Inuit Eskimos;
The reflected image of some part
Of oneself in the eye, bark or pelt
Of every living other:
So when we care for others,
We are caring for ourselves,
As when we harm another,
We also harm ourselves.

Through all the strife and discord
Strings and chords of harmony
Spring from the wild heart core
Of the infinite, illimitable realm
Of all beginnings and ends.
They connect our souls and minds
With the unseen between
And within the seen. The Peace
‘Which passeth all understanding’
Then comes to Earth through us.

Weather, like our emotions,
Ranges and changes, nurturing,
Harming, annihilating, recreating
Beyond all love, hate, hope, despair,
Arising from the is-ness and it-ness, 
Such-ness and otherness which abide
In the oneness of an eternal present;
An omniscient omnipresence
We feel in the first breath of spring,
Monsoon raindrops in the jungle breeze
Abuzz with wild honey bees
Before the hiss of distant galaxies
Sets the night air a-tingle to tiger ears
Beyond the clamour of our insanity
And Buddhist monks steaming snow
From their soul-ignited backs.

It is this miracle we live and breathe
Though joy and pain, forever blessed:
For ever healing, making whole,
Our hallowed Earth and home,
Sun swallowed, bright and beautiful
Until the next earthquake or tornado
As Shiva dances this cosmic cycle
And Pan still plays his pipes.

             FOR WILLIAM BLAKE
(Who raged against my homeland England’s ‘satanic mills.’)

'William Blake was no flake or fake.
He journeyed into the minds of men
Long, deep and very far,
Where some may weep, or rage, or sleep,
Or leap with joy and sing their star!'

Many rage with poet Dylan Thomas 
Against the dying of the light,
But so it always must before the coming
Of the dawn, and each new age of man.

The age of Peace is our release
From fear and hatred, vengeance, lust,
For all have trust and know the truth
That we are part of one stupendous whole,
Not man nor tree nor beast apart.
But no peace can ever be
Until every creature we set free.

Oh mystery! Oh majesty!
The awe igniting, reverence inciting
Wonder of the mind that senses,
Feels, and knows the wordless hymns
Of ancient trees and Monarch butterflies!

THE FALLING TOWERS
I have seen how your towers
Of glass and steel,
Ephemeral, unreal, so transient,
Erected by unnatural, alien powers,
Scrape and pierce the sky,
Obliterate horizon’s light
And blind the stars at night.

By day they hum for mammon
As I feel the earth tremble, drained,
Your elevated state sustained.
Your shadow stain spreads pain and blight
Across the land you rent and rent,
Sucking the marrow out of life
Emptying souls’ imagination
To accommodate profane creation,
Commerce, vital information,
Imperatives of global trade, control.

Towers of glass and steel,
Monuments to desire, inspire
A domineering state of mind
That sees a ravaged, vanquished Earth
As human progress; evolution:
Ingress to a world made new,
The promised  land deserved and won
By a chosen few who claim their god
Made them in His own image
As they have remade the world 
Into their own image, blind,
Unfeeling as their god,
To injustice, desecration.

Food from petrochemical-soaked fields
Courses through fetal brains without distinction.
Offspring of the rich play nihilistic computer games
With no countryside to run and find the wild,
Learn the names of things that feel and heal 
Now obliterated by factory farms,
Silos for storing grain, nuclear weapons underground.
Acid rains kill ocean life, forests sickening,
Heralding the quickening of extinction.
The Hopis call this the Purification
Of Koyaanasquatsi, life out of balance,
For those living in the absence of the sacred
Who even spread and profit from disease,
Deny their role in climate change
And feel no pang across the range
Where buffalo and wolves once roamed
Amid the lush of prairie grass and singing larks.

I have seen the consequences of such dominion
For which there is no solution
Beyond my disbelief and outrage
Of this illusion of civilization.
Indigenous species, peoples disenfranchised,
Put in the zoo and reservation
In the name of feel-good conservation
To endure the poverty of spirit
Multiplying now in urban slums.

Every revolution in the name
Of Freedom, Justice and Equality
Fails the test of evolution
When most within the towers
And those without---
The ever multiplying minions
Of poor, oppressed, homeless, landless,
Whose leaders, political and religious, 
Sanctify ever more violence and war---
Feel, think, strive only for themselves.
Unmindful of the trees,
The oceans, and the least of these
Creatures from other realms, nations
Who express, embody and sustain
The life and beauty of the first world,
The original, the aboriginal.

The towers of glass and steel
Will all soon reel and fall,
Heralding their End of Days
As Nature’s Powers defy,
Purify, restore and reify
The womb of life on planet Earth,
The First Creation,
Some future consciousness may cherish, 
Hold as holy, sanctify.
The final solution lies in living mindfully
Of the countless ways we act
In the absence of the sacred,
To recover our humanity and sanity
Through reverence for all life,
Seeking peaceful co-existence 
With all creatures great and small.
To walk in the grace of devotion
For all the beloved we cherish,
A consummation devoutly to be wished.

THE WAY TO PEACE
We speak in many tongues,
 but from what heart?
 Hearts of love bring joy and peace;
 Hearts of fear more hatred, war.

 In Freedom’s name, some self-immolate,
 take eye for eye and blind the world.
 Suicide-bombers, kami kazis, martyrs,
 victims, victors, tyrants, liberators
 speak their truth from age to age
  in many tongues. Now cyber-babble’s 
  heartless language fills the world
   while terrorists and religions intertwine.

  Towers of babble come tumbling down.
  Where are those who knew the language
  of the trees and sang with whales and wolves?
   They who know can show the way to peace:

  Obedient always to the Golden Rule,
  They live in grace on hallowed land
  beyond the end of inhumanity
  and births of empty souls.

 Beyond the paradox of life in death,
Life gives to life, as we can chose. 
Then peace will come
And all our slaughtering end.

       EVERY HEALER KNOWS
Every healer knows the Medicine Wheel
Is the Sacred Hoop the Hopis dance.
The drum-beat heart of Earth
Is in their feet, and eagles’ wings,
As well the air we share.

Every healer, dancer, knows
The Hoop is broken now
But not beyond repair
If our will is in harmony
With the Power that moves us all
To care for the last of the wild
And the unborn of every kind.

Every healer knows to do no harm,
And in our healing of Nature
Is the healing of self.
The drum-beat heart of Earth
Is in our feet, and eagles’ wings,
As well the air we share.

 FOR EVER HEALED
Come join the Sun dance,
Call up the ancestors-
Beloveds gone, mothers---
 Children, warriors, elders---
-Good dogs, horses, crows
 Flying in on dream clouds
 To dance around the Truth
 With all of us, every love
 And wound and wrong
  Remembered, shared, atoned
  Inside the circle around the Tree;
 The scent of day, the Mother drums  
 To Fathers’ feet in falling rain.
Kinship affirmed,
 All relations* honored. 
The covenant is sealed, 
 And all are healed,
Affinities sublime, illimitable.

Praying now, what lights
In many forms may come
To show and guide us
We thank and celebrate.
* With tree, and Thou, and thee and thy, and all on land, in sea and sky who crawl or swim, or fly or skim, or walk and talk, or pray and stay the sacred way.
 Dedicated to my Wailaki Indian friend, Ben Coyote.

                  THE HOLARCHY
            ( Where holarchists unite!)

The ethos of the natural world,
The law of Nature, creation’s code,
Is evolution or extinction; adapt or die. 

Through the prism of culture, time and place,
Darwin saw in Nature some primal hierarchy
Of competition and survival of the fittest. 
Others used his vision as scientific proof
Of human superiority, and to justify the hegemony
Of industrialism and colonial imperialism
As natural human evolutionary progression
Biologically predetermined, if not God-ordained. 

Kropotkin saw creative anarchy and mutual aid
That others warped into self-serving anarchism,
Paternalism, patriarchy, and mass-control.

Black Elk saw the Medicine Wheel,
---The holists’ vision of the holy,
Wherein all is sacred, co-dependent---
As the web of life we each must hallow, heal.
He led his people to live in harmony
‘With the Power of the world as it lives
and moves and does its work’.

Now under the chauvinistic monarchy
Of human domination, Nature, animals
Are simply resources to exploit
Consume, abuse, transform.
The monoculture of the technocratic mind
Mirrors wastelands emptied of the wild,
Making inscapes of every child
Devoid of images Nature made.
No imagination in an Earth un-souled,
Hominized, homogenized
By ignorant oligarchies of greed.

Evolve or perish, adapt or die,
The credo of creation long ignored;
Devolution unforeseen, progress mere illusion;
Virtual realities of Homo technos
Bereft of virtue, spirit, mystery.

No solution but dissolution
Without the Rx for evolution---
Revolution in our ways of seeing
And of human being and becoming
In the holarchy of communion
With all sentient beings
And worlds within worlds.

Uncounted realms, spheres, orbits
Of existence, mind, action,
Spark our senses in the gravity
Of the draw of space illimitable.
The loneliness of our knowing
Consumes our lives unshared
Until we face the Mystery
And embrace each other
In the certainties of death and night
To unveil the immortal nature
Of boundless love’s unfettered souls.
Then alone like stars we shine apart
In radiance born to all unite
With constellations of harmony and peace
In nascent galaxies near and far.
 July, 2009
Dedicated to the late Thomas Berry who saw that “The universe is not a collection of objects but a communion of subjects.”

THE END OF THE RACE
Be of good cheer;
The end of the race is near;
The end of the human race.
I see only three riders left
In this mad human race---
Ignorance, Indifference and Fear.

Power and Arrogance, along with
Righteousness and Retribution,
Began this biocidal  surge.
Cleverness and Cunning
Could not keep up, 
And neither Honesty and Trust,
Nor Morality, Law and Order.

Certitude and Science
Helped lose the race
As the Age of Plenty,
After the Age of Reason,
Became the Age of Treason
Against Nature, Sanity and Grace.

It will soon be over, 
Nature will purge the race, 
And in its place
Humility and Compassion,
Devotion’s sacred powers,
Will find their way
Into every human soul,
Imbuing all to heal,
Nurture, cherish and inspire.

How else to live
Within the cataclysms
Of cosmic wombs
And before the catechisms
Of sentient life
Throughout the universe
As undiscovered as the laws
Of Nature’s Wisdom,
And the Power of Love
Inherent in us all.

EVOLVE OR PERISH: A PARADIGM SHIFT
 ‘Physician, first heal thyself,
And do no harm’,
 Hippocrates advised;
Let your medicine be your food
And your food be your medicine.
From himsa, harmfulness,
To ahimsa, non-harming
Is a paradigm shift:
A conscious evolutionary step
For Homo not-so-sapient man:
---Biologically, a survival imperative.
Evolve or perish. Shift---
From anti-bios, to probios; 
From antibiotics to probiotics:
From dysbiosis to eubiosis;
From warring against
To working together, 
From humiliating to humility,
Making peace, not war
With weeds and bugs
Treating Earth as Mother
Soil her living flesh.
From humus comes humility,
And through our metanoia,
Empathy, and the humor
Of becoming one with the dance,
The Dreamer of life,
And songs of stars and whales.

ADDENDUM
                   One Pilgrim’s Way
Going to the ponds to explore their inner lives 
Contained within their steep and muddy banks
The child found conscious life in a myriad forms
Within a world within a world of miracles
 The wonder and mysteries of all
Seeding wisdom, awe and reverence in his heart. 

The boy collected with avidity and risk,
Pond “specimens” for closer study, even retention
In his biological collection.
This natural science revealed Creation’s art,
 Nature’s laws and poetry of life
Celebrated in Blackbird’s evensong 
And the teeming wombs of ponds.

Other boys stole Blackbirds’ eggs,
Left blown up frogs around the ponds.
Adults drowned kittens in sacks
Threw in in their refuse
Then the ponds were land-filled 
To build more homes,
Spreading suburban blight.
Nature out of mind and gone from sight.

Adolescent tensions between
 The civilized and the wild,
The contrived and the authentic
Nascent in the natural child,
Tore him into two and for a while
He lost himself in others of the world
But not in it; aliens eating lambs,
Shooting wolves, making animals suffer
To find profitable cures for their own dis-ease.
Then the animals in his world
Whom he rescued, knew and loved,
Brought him to his senses
And the two became one.

The man raised and studied wolves
Finding the best and worst of human nature shared
But wolves more loyal to family and clan,
 Superior stewards of the Earth
Living in accord with Nature’s laws.
He played with wolves who sang to his flutes
Making music in their bond of harmony:
Communion with the wild, vision quest of child
Completed, Self-realized and affirmed
In the feral otherness and baptism
In Nature’s realm that blesses, nurtures all
Outside of temple, church and synagogue.

With a veterinary education the man
Sought to heal the broken bonds
Between his kind and other animals
As well the living Earth they shared:
One World, One Health,
The medicine of the wolf.

He held his children high
To see the sky and stars,
Read the clouds and winds
Feel the rain upon their faces
To become what they were shown.
They too learned the love of wolves
And all the other animals who shared
Their lives and crossed their paths.

Drawn in his sunset years
To the essences of healing plants
He felt eternal gratitude for the gifts of life.
Before redeeming death’s release
From suffering and mourning Earth,
Broken wings and falling trees.
He gave his last breath
To pray for his fallen race
To be restored to grace
Recovering compassion from extinction
By hallowing every living place
And all who dwell therein.

FOR MY MOTHER-In Memoriam
      (Minnie Elizabeth Wilson Fox)
In my attentive father’s shadow
I remember how you helped me
Stand, walk, speak and spell;
Dispel childhood fears and fevers, 
And explore the wondrous world
My senses sought to fill my soul.

Your delight in me reflected
My delight in every living thing:
Radiant crocus heralding spring;
Dancing butterflies, the labouring ant;
Blackbirds singing in the dell.

You preened my wings’ imagination 
To go beyond the speed of thought
Into what Nature wrought and taught
A child becoming father of the man
Who sought to comprehend and care
For every creature of Her creation.

As I was cherished,
So I came to cherish all.
Mother of every hue,
Inspired, enthused, embraced
The life around me and within,
I thank you for the gift of you.

You taught me courage and frugality
In the time of war with father gone.
Only me to care for you with open heart.

The light of life you lived
And shared with all
Especially in your Yoga classes
You gave till ninety-five.
Then close to ninety-nine
 Your freedom came,
But the gifts of you remain
In all our hearts and souls.
