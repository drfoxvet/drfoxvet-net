LAWNS BE GONE!
From Dr. Fox’s newspaper column Animal Doctor with Andrews McMeel Syndication


FOR LIFE’S SAKE TRANSFORM THE LAWNS, May 4th 2021



DEAR DR. FOX, I am writing to alert your readers to an important and eye-opening book, Professor Doug Tallamy's Nature's Best Hope, (Timber Press, Inc., 2020), in which the author describes the dire threat to our native insect, bird and plant species and proposes a hopeful solution in which we can all participate. If everyone in the United States repurposed just half of their yards to make space for native species of plants, shrubs and trees, Tallamy argues, we would create a vast network of "homegrown national parks" that would provide more wildlife habitat than all of the national parks combined.


The days when our windscreens were encrusted with squashed bugs and our patio lights were surrounded by a haze of flying insects are now a distant source of nostalgia. How many monarch butterflies did you see last summer? How many Luna moths and praying mantises? How many box turtles? How many salamanders, frogs and toads? If you live in the vast swaths of urban, suburban and exurban America, the answer was most likely precious few, and certainly only a small fraction of what you encountered as a child. Monarch butterfly populations today are a mere 4% of their 1970s levels. And while Monarchs are charismatic and more visible than most insects, their fate is typical of about 90% of plant-eating insects.


Major factors contributing to these population crashes are herbicides, pesticides and habitat fragmentation. The well-manicured American lawn, long a cultural norm and status symbol, is a toxic wasteland for most of our native species. The native plants upon which our birds and insects depend have been replaced almost wholesale with introduced species of ornamental trees, shrubs, flowers and turf with which they have no evolutionary relationship. Whereas an introduced ornamental tree might host at most several butterfly and moth species (the larvae of which are crucial food for baby birds), a native oak tree can host over 500 species. https://www.wildaboutnativeplants.com/blog/2019/3/4/landscape-stewardship-step-1-plant-a-native-tree 


This spring, beautiful as I find the gardens and yards in my neighborhood with their tulips and daffodils and flowering ornamental trees, they now make me sad because they also represent a huge wasted opportunity to support our struggling native species. I live in a condo but I went to https://www.monarchwatch.org/ and purchased some milkweed plants for a friend's yard, and I feel a little better.

B.K., Washington DC


DEAR B.K., I have raised the issue of private and corporate lawns, public parks and playgrounds and golf courses in earlier columns that mean air and noise pollution from mowers, application of fertilizers that can cause toxic algae to bloom in close-by lakes and application of life-harming insecticides and herbicides, including human life, wildlife and our animal companions.

 The “perfect” lawn is an abomination and is a creation of  agri-chemical industry risk-denying cupidity and enculturated public stupidity.
According to Bee City USA (https://beecityusa.org/welcome-pollinators-to-your-lawn-with-no-mow-may/) “ No Mow May is a conservation initiative first popularized by Plantlife, an organization based in the United Kingdom, but which is gaining traction across North America. The goal of No Mow May is to allow grass to grow unmown for the month of May, creating habitat and forage for early season pollinators. This is particularly important in urban areas where floral resources are often limited. 


Beyond Pesticides reported on March 30, 2020 that Beyond Pesticides sued TruGreen, the national chemical landscaping company, for misrepresenting the safety of the toxic chemicals that it uses to treat lawns. The case is Beyond Pesticides v. TruGreen (DC Superior Court, Case No. 2020CA001973B, March, 20, 2020). At the same time, the organization is urging all states to prohibit toxic chemical spraying in neighborhoods as non-essential and hazardous. Widespread exposure to lawn pesticides, which are immune system and respiratory toxicants, can elevate serious risk factors associated with COVID-19 (coronavirus). TruGreen uses the weed killer glyphosate (Roundup), which is identified by IARC of the World Health Organization as probably carcinogenic. It uses a chlorophenoxy (Tri-Power) another weed killer whose label warns of “irreversible eye damage” and “allergic reactions.” Another hazardous pesticide identified in the lawsuit is triclorfon (Dylox), a neurotoxic organophosate insecticide.”


Time to stop this insanity.


Herbicides Cost Lives and More  July 19, 2020



Before being purchased by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, Monsanto Corp. demanded that I retract my comments about the many health and environmental risks of their herbicide Roundup, which I refused to do, and they sent a letter discrediting my science-based concerns to all newspapers that published my article. Now, in one of the largest civil settlements in U.S. history, Bayer has agreed to allocate close to $10 billion to resolve around 125,000 filed and unfiled cases claiming its glyphosate-based weed-killer Roundup causes cancer. The deal will still allow Bayer to sell Roundup without adding any warnings, The New York Times reported. It comes after three juries in early, high-profile trials awarded more than $2.4 billion to plaintiffs who developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after long-term Roundup use.


This herbicide, still widely used in agriculture and around private property by homeowners and public places by municipalities is often combined with the herbicide 2,4-D, which is also used separately to kill “weeds” invading lawns. 2,4-D is an endocrine disruptor that can damage thyroid gland function and is a potential carcinogen. A 2004 study by Purdue University scientists showed that Scottish terriers exposed to lawns treated with herbicides such as 2,4-D had greater risk of bladder cancer than other terriers. A 1991 National Cancer Institute study concluded that dogs exposed to just four lawn treatments a year significantly increased their risk of malignant lymphoma. (For details visit ewg.org/research/24D/pets-wildlife-24D.)


In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer declared 2,4-D a possible human carcinogen, based on evidence that it damages human cells and, in a number of studies, caused cancer in laboratory animals. More conclusive is the proof that 2,4-D falls into a class of compounds called endocrine-disrupting chemicals, compounds that mimic or inhibit the body's hormones. Laboratory studies suggest that 2,4-D can impede the normal action of estrogen, androgen and most conclusively, thyroid hormones. Dozens of epidemiological, animal and laboratory studies have shown a link between 2,4-D and thyroid disorders. (nrdc.org/stories/24-d-most-dangerous-pesticide-youve-never-heard).


Homeowners, community leaders, municipal authorities, and state and federal agencies involved in regulating the use of these and other chemicals in agriculture need to stop this insanity. Organic farmers are leading the way, along with books for homeowners like Doug Tallamy’s "Nature’s Best Hope," to get rid of their perfect lawns and landscape with indigenous plants for the benefit of insects, birds, other wildlife -- and our own health as well as our animal companions.


DEAR DR. FOX: Is there a supplement that is safe to give my two dogs in order to stop yellowing of my grass when they urinate? I looked into gypsum for the lawn, but it seems to do more harm to the grass than good. They currently eat a little kibble mixed with your dog food twice a day and added vegetables (Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, carrots) and fruits (blueberries or apples) once a day. -- T.G., Tulsa, Oklahoma


DEAR T.G.: I am frequently asked this question and my response has usually ruffled some feathers. There are fraudsters out there selling various products to give to dogs with the claim that their urine will be changed so the lawn grass will not be harmed. These products are not FDA-approved and need not be if they are marketed not as drugs but as food supplements.


Any compound that changes the acidity/alkalinity of a dog's urine is altering complex biochemical processes and could cause harm, including disrupting the normal bacterial flora in the urinary tract that prevents cystitis and infections.


The three solutions that I offer are: 1. Adding a little milk or low- or zero-salt chicken bouillon (you can make your own) to your dogs' drinking water so they drink more and have less concentrated urine. 2. Soak the grass sod where your dogs have urinated with a liberal dousing of water at the end of the day to dilute their urine. 3. Put down sand and a layer of pea-gravel in one area where the dogs can evacuate in your yard, and let the rest return to the wild by seeding various indigenous perennial grasses, flowers and shrubs.

FOR DOGS' SAKE, GET RID OF THE LAWNS! Aug 1st 2016

Agriculture should not take all the blame for chemical fertilizers and pesticides harming water quality. What MUST be addressed in suburbia is the lawns, soaked in chemicals by homeowners and lawn "treatment" companies that "fertilize" and kill "weeds" with various chemicals that the rains, lawn sprinklers and irrigation systems flush into ground and surface waters, which we eventually drink or that evaporate into the clouds and come back down in the rain.
From my perspective as a veterinarian and from my early memories that make me mourn the loss of night bugs and wildflowers along the highways and byways, I can only shake my head in disbelief. The golden springs of flowering dandelions, so nutritious, packed with vitamins, minerals and enzymes and with multiple phytochemicals with properties that can cure certain cancers and improve liver and kidney function, if not the workings of our brains, is a call to arms rather than to reverence and celebration. They are, along with other "invasive" herbs and wildflowers, rooted out or sprayed with herbicides that cause or aggravate the very maladies that the dandelions' leaves and roots, and essences of other wild plants, can cure!


What more to say except that children play on these lawns and sprayed park land, sidewalks and playing fields, where susceptible dogs like the Scottish terrier are likely to develop cancer of the bladder and others, cancer of the lymphatic system.


Some may wonder where the bees and butterflies have gone. Others will not care or remember. Where I live in suburban Minnesota, few homeowners have turned their lawns into rain gardens, milkweed havens and flowering meadows. Every evening we hear the sound of lawn mowers and weed whackers before the smoky stench of outdoor barbecues, converting animal flesh into tasty carcinogens, rises to pollute the gloaming. Then the street and yard lights come on to obliterate the stars, and in a twinkling of recall, I see no more fireflies in the gloom.


But beyond a sense of pending doom, I see a glimmer of hope in the scintillating semaphore of vibrant colors from the wings of the birds and butterflies among our weeds and falling linden trees that speak the universal language of the heart. This war on "weeds" (like other wars triggered by generally unfounded fears, an adversarial and arrogant state of mind and distorted perception) must end, along with our collective ignorance and indifference to all that lives and gives.
