Dealing With Canine Dementia
From Dr. Fox's Animal Doctor syndicated newspaper column Dec 2022

Dear Dr. Fox,

During the last couple of months, our 12 year old terrier mix's nighttime behavior has changed.  After a certain time of night, (approximately 7:30/8 pm), he begins to pace, pant, and keeps going to the door to be let out.  We stopped letting him out until the last 'out' of the night since it doesn't appear he has to relieve himself. He will sometimes settle down, then get up to start all over again.

About twice a week he gets up in the middle of the night, paces, pants, and paws the bed. We let him out briefly, then he seems to settle down, though he has woken us up 2-3 times in one night a few times.

His weekday routine is: one 15 minute walk in the morning, outside in the backyard around 3-4 pm, dinner at around 4:30 pm, 40 minute walk around 5 pm, 15 minute walk around 9:30 pm (last out). On the weekends, he spends more time in the backyard, but this doesn't seem to alter the night behavior.

Until recently, he has always been able to sleep at night for 10 hours without trouble.  His last blood work was six months ago and everything was normal.

About 6 months ago we switched him to Blue Buffalo life protection formula for seniors and he eats this with cooked chicken mixed in it.  He has never been interested in eating in the morning, though we have always left dry food for him in his bowl in case he gets hungry.

We have read about this behavior in dogs with dementia, but are not sure if this is the issue.  I have not seen an article about this on your site.  What steps do you suggest?

Thank you.
