LOW COST SUPPLEMENTS MAY HELP PREVENT ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND COGNITIVE DECLINE IN CATS AND DOGS

By Dr. Michael W. Fox

New research shows that the combination of B vitamins and omega-3 are a dynamic duo against dementia, stopping the brain shrinking by over 70 per cent.

The research has found that giving older people with the first signs of cognitive impairment supplemental B vitamins (B6, B12 and folic acid) at higher levels than can be achieved through diet to those with sufficient omega-3 fats produced 73% less brain shrinkage in a year, compared to placebo. This reduction brought brain shrinkage down to the level found in those elderly with no cognitive decline.
 These documented findings could help with canine age-related cognitive decline and brain changes in ageing cats that are analogous to Alzheimer’s disease. For details go to Fairbairn, P British Journal of Nutrition,2023 129(3), 428-441.

I would also consider Taurine as a supplement since researchers examined 250 mice who were roughly 45 years of age in human terms. Each day the mice were either given taurine or a control solution. The mice that were given taurine had an increased lifespan of 12% in females and 10% in males. ( See Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging by Parminder Singh et al SCIENCE 9 Jun 2023 Vol 380, Issue 6649 DOI: 10.1126/science.abn9257).

In addition organic coconut oil given orally, has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties and is also beneficial for slowing cognitive decline (Fernando WM et al. The role of dietary coconut for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease: potential mechanisms of action. Br J Nutr. 2015 Jul 14;114(1):1-14. doi: 10.1017/S0007114515001452). Coconut oil also helps reduce seizures in epileptic dogs.


Judicious use of vitamin D3 supplements may also be beneficial in preventing cognitive decline and has multiple systemic health benefits.( Gallagher JC. Vitamin D and aging. Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am. 2013 Jun;42(2):319-32. doi: 10.1016/j.ecl.2013.02.004.). Note: excessive levels of Vitamin D can be toxic and have resulted in some pet food recalls from ingredient formulation errors.
